== Description ==

This plugin will add avatars of comment-authors to the comment-feeds of your WordPress-Blog. This is done by utilizing the native WordPress-function [`add_avatar()`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Gravatars#Theme_Support_for_WordPress_2.5 "add_avatar docu at the Codex").

The plugin may add a snapshot from [websnapr.com](http://websnapr.com "websnapr.com") to the pingbacks and trackbacks you receive.

This page and the plugin are still in development. Stay tuned for the first release, which will happen in a few days.
